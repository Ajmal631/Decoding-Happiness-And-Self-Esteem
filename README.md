# Decoding Happiness and Self-Esteem: The Statsitical Way
**Statistical Insights into the Drivers of Happiness and Self-Esteem**

This project aimed to identify the factors associated with an individualâ€™s happiness and self-esteem. We began by designing a questionnaire that incorporated standard psychological scales to measure happiness and self-esteem, along with questions on potential influencing factors. After conducting the survey, I mentored the team through the stages of data preprocessing and analysis. The Analysis involved data visualization, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and goodness of fit, using tools such as MS Excel, RExcel, SPC, and R.

Our findings revealed that variables such as age, number of close friends, height, family income, educational qualifications, exercise frequency (days), and exercise duration (time) are significantly associated with either happiness, self-esteem, or both.
